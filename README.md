# GitBrowser
A simple Github repository browser written in React-native. It uses the GitHub API. Currently, this is only written for and tested on IOS.

## Features
- Browse the top trending repositories
- Search repositories
- View repository details; currently can read the README and see which languages are used
- Log in (using OAuth) to remove API limitations

*Still in its early MVP stage, besides adding new features, a lot of refactoring still needs to be done.*
